What do college professors do? 

College professors design course curriculum and instruct students in their academic specialty at a higher education institution. They also regularly do research in their area of interest and publish articles and books to develop their academic reputation. 

Many college professors teach part-time in addition to another career in their field, while others might focus exclusively on teaching and academic research. College professors also provide support and motivation for their students.
